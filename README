ENCE260 - DANCE DANCE C-EVOLUTION (TETRIS EDITION)
Created by Jaymee Chen and Bede Nathan

Have the board so that the NAVSWITCH is on the top left corner.

HOW TO START
1. 'make program' onto both UCFK4 microcontroller boards.
2. Have both IR transmitters/receivers facing each other.
3. Press the push button on one of the boards to be the receiver and start the game.
   The sender will be indicated through the BLUE LED.

HOW TO PLAY

Each player starts off with three lives. Both players are able to control their arrow regardless of their status (sender or receiver). 
Once the winning/losing screen has finished scrolling, players are able to restart by pressing the push button.

CONTROLS:
NAVSWITCH UP - rotate arrow clockwise
NAVSWITCH DOWN - rotate arrow counter-clockwise
NAVSWITCH LEFT - move arrow left
NAVSWITCH RIGHT - move arrow right
NAVSWITCH PUSH - send arrow (only if player is sender)

The player who is the sender first will start off with 2 moves. This will gradually increase as the game progresses. The sender will
rotate their arrow with the controls above and send arrows to the receiver. The receiver should rotate their arrow so it matches the
position and rotation of the incoming arrows. If the receiver does not match the incoming arrow, they will lose a life. 
Once the sender has used all their moves and the receiver has successfully matched all incoming arrows, they will swap roles.
